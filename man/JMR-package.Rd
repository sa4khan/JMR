\title{The 'JMR' package.}
\description{
While the main focus of this package involves recurrent event data analysis and joint modeling, 
   it also includes fitting regression models for right censored (non-recurrent) time-to-event data. 
   For the time-to-event process, available options are Weibull, log-logistic, log-normal, exponentiated Weibull and generalized gamma 
   accelerated failure time models, and Weibull and generalized log-logistic proportional hazards models. 
   This package also includes several utility functions, including functions for residual analysis, data simulation and dynamic predictions. 
   Maximum likelihood method is used to fit recurrent event models, whereas Bayesian approach (implemented in Stan) 
   is used for joint modeling. The 'rstan' package is used to parse, compile, test, estimate and analyze Stan models.
