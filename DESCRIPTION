Description: While the main focus of this package is recurrent event data analysis and joint modeling, it also includes fitting regression models for right censored (non-recurrent) time-to-event data. Available options are Weibull, log-logistic, log-normal, exponentiated Weibull and generalized gamma accelerated failure time models, and Weibull and generalized log-logistic proportional hazards models. This package also includes residual analysis, data simulation and dynamic predictions. Maximum likelihood method is used to fit recurrent event models, whereas Bayesian approach (implemented in Stan) is used for joint modeling. The rstan package is used to parse, compile, test, estimate and analyze Stan models.
